# Magion-Scatterplot-Matrix

This project is a entry for the PI Visualisation Hackathon (https://pisquare.osisoft.com/community/developers-club/hackathons/blog/2017/01/13/visualization-virtual-hackathon)

It contains all the files and folders needed for adding a custom Coresight symbol. Place everything in the "ext" folder.
This symbol is compatible with Coresight 2016 R2 and Coresight Vision (2017)
